In this post, we will explore Mongo Database along with Mongoose and cover all basic CRUD operations. But first, we will demonstrate the complexity of setting up
Mongo database using the MongoDriver. 

Sign-up 
1. Go to mongodb.com and sign up for an account. 
**install mongosh on the root directory of your system 

Database setup
1. Create a project folder and an app.js file in that folder. 
2. terminal npm init to initialize npm
3. install mongodb from npm 
4. require mongodb add .MongoClient to end and be sure to set it equal to MongoClient
5. require assert 
6. start mongod from the terminal at the home directory.
7.  in a new tab from the terminal use "mongo" to start the mongo shell 
8. in our app.js, create a const url and set it to "mongodb://localhost:27017"
9. in our app.js, create a constant dbName and set it to a string, this will be the name of our database. 
10. creat a new client by setting a const client = new MongoClient(url) 
11. **optional** {useNewUrlParser:true}
12. attached the connect method to our client and pass it a function with a perameter of error. 
13. inside this function attach the equal method to our assert and pass it null and error - this will assess if errors are equal to null which means our server is 
    connected
14. log out to the console that you have sucessfully connected to the server 
15. also inside the same function create a constant called db and set it to client.db(dbName)
If everything is setup correctly, when you run node app.js your success log should be read out to the console

C - Create 
1. create a constatnt called insertDocuments and set it equal to a function with the parameters of db and callback. 
2. within this function create another constant called collection and set it to db.collection("_____"); filling in your collection name you want to create. 
3. then call collection.insertMany([], function(err,result){});
4. in our array (the first paramater of insertMany, we will place our documents. Each document is encased in {} and filled with key value pairs. Sepparated
   by commas. 
5. in our err result function we can use assert.equal to set parameters for inserting our data (ie. there must be # documents) then callback(result);
6. in our client.connect place  insertDocuments(db, function () {client.close();
If everything is done correctly, when you run node app.js and then use the mongo shell to show our databases, select our database, show our collections then display 
them using db.collectionName.find()

R- read
1. create a constant called findDocuments
2. set it equal to a function with the perameters of db and callback.
3. inside this function, declare a constant called collection and set it equal to db.collection('_____'); creating a collection with the name youve filled in. 
**if the collection name doenst exist it will be created and return an empty colleciton**
4. then call collection.find({}) to go through the entire collection then add the .toArray(function(err, _____ ){ filling in the name of the collection. 
5. inside this function set assert.equal(err,null); to check if there are any errors when the data is being passed into the array. if not log "found the following records"
6. then use the callback function and pass it the name of the collection
7. Finally in our client.connect function call our findDocuments and pass it db and a void function. 
8. In the function call client.close() to close our connection after reading in our data. 

U - update 
** look to the documentation for other methods on updating database, this is just one **
1. In your mongo shell type db.collectionName.updateOne({},{}) 
2. In our first collection, we will place the key value pair that selects the SPECIFIC document we want to update (best way is to choose the _id: ObjectId("####'))
3. In our second collection, we will place the action that we want our update to take. The options are as follows:
    1. $set: - Adds new fields to documents.
    2. $unset:- Removes/excludes fields from documents.
    3. $replaceWith: - Replaces the input document with the specified document.
4. Inside our second collection we will create another collection with the key value pair that we want to perform this action on. 

D - delete 
1. In the mongo shell type out db.collectionName.deleteOne({})
2. inside the collection pass in the key value pair of the document you want to delete (best way is to use the _id)
